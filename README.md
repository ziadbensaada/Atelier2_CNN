## here's a brief synthesis of what I've learned:

Understanding of PyTorch: Through implementing various neural network architectures such as CNN, Faster R-CNN, and ViT using PyTorch, I gained a deeper understanding of how to work with PyTorch, including defining models, optimizing parameters, and training models.

Computer Vision Architectures: I learned about different neural network architectures commonly used in computer vision tasks, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks (RCNNs), and Vision Transformers (ViTs). Each architecture has its strengths and weaknesses and is suitable for different types of tasks.

MNIST Dataset: I worked with the MNIST dataset, which is a popular benchmark dataset for image classification tasks. This dataset consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits and is widely used for training and evaluating machine learning models.

Training and Evaluation: I gained experience in training neural networks on image data using both training and testing datasets. I learned about defining loss functions, selecting appropriate optimizers, and evaluating model performance using metrics such as accuracy, F1 score, and loss.

Comparison of Models: I compared the performance of different models, including CNN, Faster R-CNN, and ViT, on the MNIST dataset. This comparison helped me understand the strengths and weaknesses of each model and how they perform on a specific task.

Hyperparameter Tuning: I explored hyperparameter tuning techniques such as adjusting learning rates, batch sizes, and model architectures to optimize model performance.

Overall, this lab provided me with valuable hands-on experience in building, training, and evaluating neural network models for computer vision tasks using PyTorch. It also helped me understand the importance of selecting appropriate models and hyperparameters based on the specific task and dataset at hand.
